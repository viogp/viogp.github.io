[HDF5 files](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/Documentation) are packed efficiently and allow to speed up calculations when dealing large quantities of data.

[HDF5 files](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/Documentation) can be quickly explored with the line commands [h5ls](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/Tutor/cmdtoolview.html#h5ls) and [h5dump](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/Tutor/cmdtoolview.html#h5dump).

[HDF5 files](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/Documentation) can be handled in many programming languages, but here I will focus on dealing with them with [`python`](https://www.python.org/).

### Opening a hdf5 file in python

[`Python`](https://www.python.org/) can handle [HDF5 files](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/Documentation) using the [h5py librery](https://www.h5py.org/). Thus the first step is to import this library and then define an object that will contain the information from our file:

```
import h5py
thefile = 'myfile.hdf5'
```

Usually, [HDF5 files](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/Documentation) contain a Header and the different types of data stored in different [groups](https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/high/group.html), which are similar to folders. 


### Writing an hdf5 file in python

We can create an output [HDF5 file](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/Documentation) using the write clause:

```
hf = h5py.File(thefile, 'w')
```

We create a header for this file with some attributes containing general information

```
# Header
head = hf.create_dataset('header',(1,))	
head.attrs[u'volume']       = 1000.
head.attrs[u'units_volume'] = u'(Mpc/h)**3'
```

We generate some data to be stored in our file.
```
# Create the edges and mid points of bins
import numpy as np
step = 1
edges = np.array(np.arange(9.,16.,step))
mhist = edges[1:]-0.5*step

# Create some random (integer) positions
pos = np.random.randint(10, size=(3, 100))
```

We store the data generated above in a group called 'data'.
```
hfdat = hf.create_group('data')
```

We add some labels with the units of the generated data.
```
hfdat.create_dataset('mass',data=mhist)
hfdat['mass'].dims[0].label = 'Mass (Msun/h)'

hfdat.create_dataset('pos',data=pos)
hfdat['pos'].dims[0].label = 'x,y,z (Mpc/h)'
```

The last thing to do is to close the newly created hdf5 file:
```
# Close the output file
hf.close()
```

We can check the content of out file using *h5ls*. To see what  is in the 'data' group we can do:
```
h5ls myfile.hdf5/data
```

### Reading a hdf5 file in python

To access the information in our [HDF5 file](https://portal.hdfgroup.org/display/support/Documentation), we open it in a read only way:
```
f = h5py.File(thefile, 'r')
```

We can acces the information in the groups of our file by either defining new variables or including the name of the group as a path (we see this later).

```
header = f['Header']
data = f['Data']
```

#### Reading the information in the header

To list all of the attributes in the header:

```
print(list(header.attrs.items()))  
```

Once we know the names of the attributes, we can access their values. Let's assume get the side of the cube from the volume:

```
boxsize = header.attrs['volume'] **(1/3)
```

#### Reading the data

The file we have created contains within the *data* group an array *mass*, and a matrix *pos*. We can store these as numpy arrays doing the following:

```
mass = data['mass'][:]
pos = data['pos'][:]
```

or

```
mass = f['data/mass'][:]
pos = f['data/pos'][:]
```

Note that *mass* will be a numpy array and *pos* a matrix.

Instead of getting all the information within *mass*, we could have only read the entries from 5 to 10, by doing:

```
mass5 = f['data/mass'][5:10]
```

We can also read the labels that accompany the information stored in the group *data*
```
print([dim.label for dim in data['pos'].dims])
print(data['pos'].dims[0].label)
```

### Closing the hdf5 file in python

```
f.close()
```
