title: Finding the IP in linux
tags: [linux]
---

* You can see your public IP typing in google: 'my ip' and also, from [this wbsite](https://www.cualesmiip.com/).

In linux you can use a GUI with name similar to 'Network Interfaces' or a line command.

* To directly get the IP:
```
hostname -I
```

* To the IP and the status of each available network adapter (Ethernet=eth#, wifi, etc):
```
ip addr show
```
```
ip a
```

* For MAC addresses. MAC address is using six groupings of two characters separated by a hyphen or colon.  i.e  ab-cd-ef-12-34-56. The second line you get from the next command will indicate the current MAC address:
```
ip link show
```


* More network tools can be found with `ifconfig`, after installation.
