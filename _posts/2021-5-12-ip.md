title: Finding the IP in linux
tags: [linux]

* You can see your public IP typing in google: 'my ip'

In linux you can use a GUI with name similar to 'Network Interfaces' or a line command.

* To directly get the IP:
```
hostname -I
```

* To the IP and the status of each available network adapter (Ethernet=eth#, wifi, etc):
```
ip addr show
```
```
ip a
```

* More network tools can be found with `ifconfig`, after installation.
