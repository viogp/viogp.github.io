["Aurors are the Wizarding World's best defence against the practitioners of the Dark Arts." â€” Harry Potter](https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Auror)

Today starts my adventure becoming an auror(a), unlearning the way I lead my career to learn new ways. Defending my path against my own (and other's) dark arts.

I am a post-doc at the [Astrophysical Research Institute](http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/), at [LJMU](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/) and I have enrolled in the [Aurora Program](https://www.advance-he.ac.uk/programmes-events/aurora#Overview).

Today, half the LJMU Aurora cohort, met with [Meriel Box](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/staff/ldf/about-us/meet-the-team), our [LJMU Aurora champion](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/staff/ldf/aurora-programme). And she mentioned blogging and here I am giving it a try!

I am delighted I got the support from my line managers, [Ian McCarthy](http://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~igm/) and [Andreea Font](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/staff-profiles/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology/astrophysics-research-institute/andreea-font), the director of my department, [Chris Collins](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/about-us/staff-profiles/faculty-of-engineering-and-technology/astrophysics-research-institute/chris-collins), and that I was selected by [LJMU](https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/), to embark in this adventure on becoming a better leader.
