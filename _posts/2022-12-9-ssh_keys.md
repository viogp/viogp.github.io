You can use **SSH keys** for the 2-Factor-Identification within [GitHub](https://github.com/). Here are the steps to follow to set your **SSH keys**:

1. Generate the pair of public and private **SSH keys**. If you want to generate a key in your laptop to connect to git, that you would like to name `laptop_git`, you should type the following command and enter a passphrase when prompted:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/laptop_git
```

2. In [GitHub](https://github.com/) go to your profile -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> click the green button with ''New SSH key'' and copy the public part of the **SSH key**:
```
laptop_git.pub
```

3. For ease of usage, in your machine you can add the following lines to the file `~/.ssh/config` (you might need to create it):   
```
Host github.com
 HostName github.com
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/laptop_git
 User git
```

Then, you are ready to clone repositories and interact with [GitHub](https://github.com/) using **SSH keys**.
