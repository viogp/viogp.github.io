[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is a softwar that allows you to work in ['containers'](https://scientific-programming.github.io/containers/) with different environments from that of your machine. For example different operating system or different versions of one operating system. Before being able to use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/):

* You need to **install** Docker following the [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) adequate to your operative system.
* Test your instalation with (in linux you might need to run first `newgrp docker`, see the [linux-postinstall](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)):
```
docker run hello-world
```
* Make an account on the website [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/).

### Compiling and running a program in a different environment

If you are going to work in a given environment for a project, you can create a directory with the program that you want to test, 'hello.cpp', and the file 'Dokerfile', with the needed comands. This is an example 'Dockerfile':

```
FROM ubuntu:16.04

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y g++

COPY . /usr/src/

WORKDIR /usr/src/

RUN g++ -o hello hello.cpp

CMD ["./hello"]
```

Then you need to build the image that will run the program, by typing in the same folder as the 'Dockerfile':
```
$ docker build -t my-gcc-app .

```

And run the Docker image
```
$ docker run -it --rm --name my-running-app my-gcc-app 

```

### Comandos docker

IMAGE = name of the image; TAG = tag name

|`docker build --tag TAG .`|builds a local image in current directory (with Dockerfile)|
|`docker images`|lists local images|
|`docker image rm IMAGE`|removes image|
|`docker run IMAGE:TAG`|runs image with IMAGE:TAG name|
|`docker ps`|lists running processes|
|`docker ps -a`|lists all processes|
|`docker start/stop IMAGE`|starts/stops image|
|`docker system prune -a`|removes any dangling and stopped resources|
