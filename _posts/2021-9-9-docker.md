[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) is a softwar that allows you to work in ['containers'](https://scientific-programming.github.io/containers/) with different environments from that of your machine. For example different operating system or different versions of one operating system. Before being able to use [Docker]https://docs.docker.com/():

* You need to **install** Docker following the [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) adequate to your operative system.
* Test your instalation with (in linux you might need to run first `newgrp docker`, see the [linux-postinstall](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)):
```
docker run hello-world
```
* Make an account on the website [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/).

### Creating a persistent image

If you are going to work in a given environment for a project, you can create a container image for that:

* Create a directory for your image (e.g. docker-myimage)
* In your directory generate a file called 'Docekerfile' with the environment you need. For example, the file 'Dockerfile' can contain:
```
from ubuntu:16.04
CMD /bin/bash
```
* Build the image from the script file, typing in the directory containing the 'Dockerfile' file:
```
docker build . -t myimage
```
* Create a container, 'mytest', from the image (YOURDOCKERNAME = username used to sign in to [Docker hub]((https://hub.docker.com/))):
```
docker create --name mytest YOURDOCKERNAME/myimage
```

### Comandos docker

|`docker ps`|lists images|
|`docker run IMAGE:TAG`|runs image with IMAGE:TAG name|
|`docker stop IMAGE-ID`|stop image with IMAGE-ID|
