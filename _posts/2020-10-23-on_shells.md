Here there are some of the commands around (linux) shells that I keep needing and I keep forgetting.

* Finding what shell is in use:
```
echo "$SHELL"
```

* Checking what are the installed shells:
```
cat /etc/shells
```

* To temporaly changing the shell, enter its name in the command line. For example to temporaly change to tcsh:
```
tcsh
```
Once you are done you can exit the temporary shell
```
exit
```


* Changing the default shell to tcsh (this will be operative at the next connection):
```
chsh -s /bin/tcsh
```
