		<p>Galaxies are hardly visible to the naked eye but telescopes are able to observed them up to very early cosmic times. I find fascinating the possibilities that they provide us to learn about where we live, a very empty Universe. The current most successful description of the Universe is filled with a mysterious energy form, the dark energy, and an elusive form of matter that has not yet been detected, the dark matter. The composition and fate of the Universe are the most fundamental aspects to be understood by humankind. </p>

	<p> My research focuses on constructing theoretical galaxies, simulated using state-
of-the-art super computers. Galaxies are cosmic lanterns that show small patches
 of cosmic history, informing us of the changes in the space-time fabric of the 
Universe. A theoretical understanding of the formation of galaxies makes them useful to understand the composition and fate of the Universe. The building blocks of galaxies are stars. Stars are formed from very dense gas collected in gravitational wells. Sometimes, this gas is consumed very fast, sometimes it remains there without producing new stars, other times the gas is stripped in incredible gravitational interactions. There are plenty of open questions about galaxies, but they can be summarised into understanding their histories in different environmental conditions. This is the core of my research, together with studying astrophysical processes that are particularly difficult to explain within our most successful model of the Universe.

<p> Emission line galaxies (ELGs) are being used as tracers of the dark matter distribution at z~1. Model [OII] emitters have luminosity functions in reasonable agreement with observations. ~95% of model ELGs are centrals hosted by haloes with M>10<sup>10.5</sup>Msunh<sup>-1</sup>. The mean halo occupation distributions of central ELGs are far away from a canonical step function and we have proposed a split contribution from disks, asymetric Gaussian, and spheroid central ELGs, soft step function.</p>

<a

How sensitive are predicted  galaxy luminosities to the choice of
stellar population synthesis  model?</a>.
<p>Galaxies are thought to form within haloes of dark matter, whose
gravity allows the galaxies to exist. The formation and evolution of
galaxies is affected by a multitude of other processes besides gravity
and computational modelling is the only way we can attempt to
understand all these processes. In this work we presenta a new
development of the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation
and evolution, which exploits a Millennium Simulation-class N-body run performed with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 cosmology. We use this new model to study the impact of the choice of stellar population synthesis (SPS) model on the predicted evolution of the galaxy luminosity function. </p>

<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.429.1609G">PAPER: The UV colours and dust attenuation of Lyman-break galaxies</a>.
<p>The study of high redshift galaxies, z>2.5, is fundamental in unveiling initial phases of galaxy evolution. However, the interpretation of the observational data is dramatically affected by dust attenuation. We explored the impact  of dust on UV luminosities using a published model of galaxy formation. I found that UV colours are very sensitive to the shape of the extinction curve used as an input for the radiative transfer model that calculates dust attenuation, stressing the difficulty of using the UV continuum slope as a tracer of dust attenuation without an understanding of the dust characteristics and geometrical distribution in high redshift galaxies.</p>

			<div class="entry">

<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.398..497G">PAPER I: Counts of Extremely Red Objects and basic properties</a>.
<p>The observed abundance of massive, high redshift galaxies with 
very red colours posed a major challenge to hierarchical clustering 
cosmologies. I presented the first example of a model which could 
explain these observations, whereas previous work had failed 
dramatically, by an order of magnitude. The key to understanding 
these objects proved to be the inclusion of heating of gas following 
the accretion of matter onto super-massive black holes at the 
centres of galaxies.</p>

<a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19294.x">PAPER II:
Clustering of Extremely Red Objects</a>.
<p>Following the breakthrough above, I studied the clustering of 
Extremely Red Objects (EROs) as a further test of the model.
The model predicts a very different distribution of galaxies 
across halos of different masses than is typically assumed, which 
has a major influence on the clustering predictions. These 
predictions agree with the currently available observations, once 
the small size of the samples is taken into account.

<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.411.1151G">PAPER: Color gradients within SDSS DR7 galaxies: hints of recent evolution</a>.
<p>The internal properties of galaxies contain information of their recent evolution. Our analysis relates, on average, steep colour gradients to a higher presence of young stars within a galaxy. Close pairs of interacting galaxies were found to present bluer cores than the average population. We also found that nuclear activity is a marginal driver for creating steep colour gradients in massive galaxies.</p>
