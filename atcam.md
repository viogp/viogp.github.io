*“Illuminating the dark sector of the Universe” ATCAM project (2019-T1/TIC-12702)*

This project aims to understand the dark sector of the Universe studying the galaxies that trace it. This sector constitutes over 95% of the total energy-matter content of the Universe. Its nature remains unknown, despite decades of continuous effort. In the next years cosmological galaxy surveys will focus on the characterisation of the dark sector of the Universe. This observational characterisation relies on having an improved understanding of galaxies as cosmological tracers. We urgently need to answer the following questions:

* How can theoretical models aid and support the interpretation of cosmological observations?
* How do galaxies trace the dark sector?
* How affected are cosmological probes by galaxy formation?
* How do galaxies trace the dark sector when different cosmologies (the global composition of the Universe) are assumed?
